    On this page, I'll give you more information on javelin.
    The javelin throw is a track and field event where the 
    javelin, a spear about 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) in length, is 
    thrown as far as possible. The javelin thrower gains 
    momentum by running within a predetermined area. 
    Javelin throwing is an event of both the men's decathlon 
    and the women's heptathlon. The javelin throw was added 
    to the Ancient Olympic Games as part of the pentathlon 
    in 708 BC.[1] It included two events, one for distance 
    and the other for accuracy in hitting a target. The 
    javelin was thrown with the aid of a thong (ankyle in 
    Greek) that was wound around the middle of the shaft. 
    Athletes held the javelin by the ankyle, a leather strap 
    around the shaft, so when they released the javelin, the 
    unwinding of the thong gave the javelin a spiral trajectory.
    Throwing javelin-like poles into targets was revived in 
    Germany and Sweden in the early 1870s. In Sweden, 
    these poles developed into the modern javelin, and 
    throwing them for distance became a common event there 
    and in Finland in the 1880s. The rules continued to 
    evolve over the next decades; originally, javelins 
    were thrown with no run-up, and holding them by the 
    grip at the center of gravity was not always mandatory. 
    Limited run-ups were introduced in the late 1890s, and 
    soon developed into the modern unlimited run-up.
