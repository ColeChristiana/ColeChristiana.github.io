  <p>
    I'm Cole Christiana, a third-year Computer Science & Business 
    Administration student at Northeastern University, concentrating 
    in Financial Technology, given my interests in digital currencies, 
    artificial intelligence, machine learning, and entrepreneurship. 
    I'm Italian-American, from New Jersey, right outside New York 
    City. I compete on the Northeastern Men's Varsity Track & Field 
    team, where I throw the javelin on an NCAA Division I level
    against universities and colleges like the University of 
    Conneticut, University of Massachusetts, Harvard University,
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston University, and
    Boston College. On top of being an athlete, I start businesses.
    In my second year, I started my first business -- a website
    called javelinlessons.com -- where you could find a javelin
    coach by location and to be the international online hub
    for everything javelin-related. In fact, through this business,
    I created the world's first javelin-related email newsletter.
    Currently, I'm working on building my second business, a marketing
    agency, leveraging what I learned at my first co-op as a 
    marketing analyst at Wayfair. I'm working to finish the certification
    for the marketing skill that I'm learning, and then I'll begin
    to build the marketing agency business itself, and finally
    begin to acquire clients through a number of outreach and inbound
    marketing efforts.
