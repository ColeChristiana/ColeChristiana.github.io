  <h2>Is There a Correlation Between Crime Type and Victim Age and Gender in LA?</h2>
  <h3>Introduction to Project</h3>
  <p>
    Crime is frequently influenced by demographic factors 
    such as age and gender. This indicates the significance
     of understanding the relationship between crime type 
     and victim age and gender in any city, to yield insights
      into strategies and initiatives to enforce the law 
      and prevent crime. Notable examples of crime type 
      affecting certain demographics include scamming 
      disproportionately affecting older populations and 
      violence affecting younger populations. Likewise, 
      males and females may experience different crimes 
      at differing rates. By analyzing crime data in Los 
      Angeles, we can identify patterns that help policymakers 
      and law enforcement create solutions and better allocate 
      resources. Moreover, understanding these correlations 
      sheds light on potential vulnerabilities of different 
      demographics and deepens our knowledge of the social 
      dynamics influencing crime.

  <h3>Introduction to Data</h3>
  <p>
    This LA crime dataset is sourced from the U.S. 
    Government’s Data Catalog and contains 9,999 
    records of reported crimes in Los Angeles from 
    July 2, 2024 to August 9, 2024 (due to the 10,000 
    row limit, a wider range of time can’t be included). 
    This dataset provides information on crime incidents, 
    including but not limited to report numbers, dates, 
    times, geographical location, crime type, descriptions, 
    classifications, victim age, victim gender, 
    victim ethnicity, and weapon involvement, 
    across 29 columns of data using a variety of data 
    types (integers, floats, and strings), making it a 
    helpful resource for analyzing crime in Los Angeles 
    to provide insights for policymakers and law enforcement.

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    Our project analyzed several patterns in how crime in 
    Los Angeles impacts different demographic groups. Our 
    analysis illustrated that theft, assault, and vandalism were 
    the most common crimes, where younger individuals were more 
    frequently victims. Also, geographic analysis showed 
    clustering in certain parts of the city, more of which 
    were centered around downtown. Gender-based patterns also 
    emerged, with females appearing more often in crimes 
    related to sexual violence, while males were more involved 
    in physical crimes such as assault and property damage. 
    Overall, the visualizations made these patterns easier 
    to understand and helped highlight the uneven distribution 
    of crime across gender, age, and geography. For future work, 
    we could find deeper insights by incorporating time-based 
    trends, neighborhood-level socioeconomic data, and changes 
    in patterns over multiple years.
