  <h2>
    Is There a Correlation Between 
    Crime Type and Victim Age and Gender in LA?
  </h2>

  <h3>
    Introduction to Project
  </h3>
  <p>
    Crime is frequently influenced by demographic 
    factors such as age and gender. This indicates 
    the significance of understanding the relationship 
    between crime type and victim age and gender in any 
    city, to yield insights into strategies and initiatives 
    to enforce the law and prevent crime. Notable examples 
    of crime type affecting certain demographics include 
    scamming disproportionately affecting older populations 
    and violence affecting younger populations. Likewise, 
    males and females may experience different crimes at 
    differing rates. By analyzing crime data in Los Angeles, 
    we can identify patterns that help policymakers and 
    law enforcement create solutions and better allocate 
    resources. Moreover, understanding these correlations 
    sheds light on potential vulnerabilities of different 
    demographics and deepens our knowledge of the social 
    dynamics influencing crime.

  <h3>
    Introduction to Data
  </h3>
  <p>
    This LA crime dataset is sourced from the U.S. 
    Government’s Data Catalog and contains 9,999 
    records of reported crimes in Los Angeles from 
    July 2, 2024 to August 9, 2024 (due to the 10,000 
    row limit, a wider range of time can’t be included). 
    This dataset provides information on crime incidents, 
    including but not limited to report numbers, dates, 
    times, geographical location, crime type, descriptions, 
    classifications, victim age, victim gender, victim 
    ethnicity, and weapon involvement, across 29 columns 
    of data using a variety of data types (integers, floats, 
    and strings), making it a helpful resource for analyzing 
    crime in Los Angeles to provide insights for policymakers 
    and law enforcement.
